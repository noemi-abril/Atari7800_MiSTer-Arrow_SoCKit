(1) CRT or LCD
(2) Bright or Dark
(3) Saturation 1 (least) - Saturation 4 (most)*
(4) CRT V1,V2,V3 or LCD V1,V2**

*For Saturation 3 and Saturation 4, there are alternative choices, located in the Alternatives folder.

**CRT_V2 or LCD_V2 is recommended as the hue start point for their respective display type:
	-CRT with less red push, try CRT_V1; CRT with less green push, try CRT_V3.
	-Try LCD_V1 for modern display interpretation containing less green push.
